# Income Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict income levels (>50K or <=50K) using a dataset containing demographic information such as age, education, workclass, occupation, etc. The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical variables and then used to train a RandomForestClassifier model for prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available as a CSV file named `incomea.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- age: Age of the individual
- education: Education level
- workclass: Type of workclass
- occupation: Occupation of the individual
- marital-status: Marital status
- relationship: Relationship status
- race: Race of the individual
- gender: Gender of the individual
- native-country: Native country of the individual
- income: Income level (>50K or <=50K)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanShash/IncomePrediction.git
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `MainIncomePrediction.ipynb` to load the dataset and train the model.
2. The notebook contains code for preprocessing the dataset, training the RandomForestClassifier model, and evaluating its performance.

## Results
- The RandomForestClassifier model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set.
- Feature importance analysis suggests that `Age`, `Education-Num/level of Education`, and `hours-per-week` are the most important features for predicting income levels.

## Future Improvements
- Further tuning of hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Experimenting with different machine learning models for comparison.

## Credits
- This project is based on a dataset from [Kaggle DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset).
- The code and documentation were created by [Daniels Shashkov](https://github.com/DanShash).
